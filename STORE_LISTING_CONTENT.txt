## 3. APP ICON (required)

- **Size:** 512 x 512 pixels
- **Format:** PNG (32-bit, no transparency for Play Store)
- **Where to get one:**
  - Use the iOS icon: open `ios/Runner/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/` and find `Icon-App-1024x1024@1x.png`. Resize it to 512x512 (e.g. in Preview: Tools → Adjust Size → 512 x 512) and upload that as the Play Store icon.
  - Or create a simple 512x512 image (e.g. with “Tambola” or a number 90) and save as PNG.
  - Or use a free generator: https://appicon.co (upload any image, download the 512x512 for Android/Play).

## 4. PHONE SCREENSHOTS (at least 2)

- **Min:** 2 phone screenshots
- **Size:** e.g. 1080 x 1920 px or 1080 x 2340 px (portrait). Play accepts various phone sizes; the simulator usually gives valid sizes.

   ```bash
   export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/flutter/bin"
   cd /Users/nallalakshmisirisha/Desktop/tambola-caller
   flutter run -d "sdk gphone64 x86 64"
   ```
2. Open the main screen (number grid) and the game/calling screen.
3. Take screenshots:
   - **Emulator:** click the camera icon in the emulator toolbar, or **Cmd+S** (Mac) / **Ctrl+S** (Windows).
   - **Phone:** power + volume down (or your device’s screenshot shortcut).
4. Upload the image files in Play Console under “Phone” screenshots (drag and drop or “Upload”).
